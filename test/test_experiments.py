"""Dynamically generate test classes for each YAML in the expected results directory.

This script automatically creates test classes for each YAML file in the
`expected_results` directory. This allows for easy addition of new test cases
and, by utilizing the experiment test core, ensures that any changes to test
methodology are automatically applied to all tests. It also essentially
eliminates DRY violations in the experiment testing process.
