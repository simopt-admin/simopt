# TODO

- Implement plotting of optimal values in the following visualization functions:
  - `plot_progress_curves`
  - `plot_terminal_feasibility`
  - `plot_terminal_progress`

- Redesign the system to specify problem objective and constraint types and how
  compatibility is calculated between solvers and problems.
