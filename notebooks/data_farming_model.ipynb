Please note that the ordering of factors in `factor_headers` must match the ordering in either `factor_settings` or `design_filename`.\n",

    "- upper_bound: The maximum value for the factor.\n",
    "- num_digits: An integer for the number of decimal places (e.g., 0 for integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Defines two factors:\n",
    "# - An integer from 0 to 10.\n",
    "# - A float from 0.00 to 1.00 (in steps of 0.01).\n",

    "Pass a string containing the path to a settings file. The file must contain three columns, with each row corresponding to a different factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns should be structured as follows:\n",
    "- Column 1: Lower bound for the factor's value.\n",
    "- Column 2: Upper bound for the factor's value.\n",
    "- Column 3: An integer for the number of digits for discretization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `design_filename`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this parameter to specify the path to a previously generated design file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file must be structured as a simple table with the following format:\n",
    "- Rows: Each row corresponds to a single design point (an experimental run).\n",
    "- Columns: The number of columns must equal the number of factors being varied.\n",
    "- Values: Each cell contains the specific value for a given factor (column) at a specific design point (row)."
