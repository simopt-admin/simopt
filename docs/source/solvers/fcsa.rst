Solver: Fully Cooperative Stochastic Approximation (FCSA)
=========================================================

Description
============

The **FCSA solver** is designed for efficient **stochastic optimization** problems with **stochastic constraints**, requiring only **first-order (gradient-based) information** of the objective and constraint functions.

The algorithm alternates between two phases:

- **Descent steps** that use stochastic gradient estimates to improve the objective value.
- **Feasibility-improvement steps** that are triggered when the current solution violates constraints.

When infeasible, the solver determines a search direction to restore feasibility by either:

1. Using the gradient of the most violated constraint (**CSA**), or
2. Solving a nonlinear program (NLP) to find the direction that forms the **maximum angle** with all violated constraints (**CSA-N**), optionally incorporating the objective gradient (**FCSA**).

When the current solution is feasible, the objective gradient alone is used to determine the search direction.
The next iterate is then computed using the **proximal mapping**.

Implementation
-------------------------------

**_direction**: Determines the search direction for infeasible iterations by finding the direction that maximizes the angle among all violated constraints, optionally including the objective constraint.

**_prox_fn**: Proximal mapping function used to compute the next solution while ensuring satisfaction of deterministic constraints.

Scope:
------

* objective_type: single
