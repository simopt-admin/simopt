Model: M/M/1 Queue
==================

Description:
------------
This is a model simulates an M/M/1 queue with an Exponential
interarrival time distribution and an Exponential service time
distribution.

Sources of Randomness:
----------------------
1. Exponential interarrival times.
2. Exponential service times.

Model Factors:
--------------
* lambda: Rate parameter of interarrival time distribution.

    * Default: 1.5

* mu: Rate parameter of service time distribution.

    * Default 3.0

* warmup: Represents the number of people as warmup before collecting statistics

    * Default: 50

* people: Represents the number of people from which to calculate the average sojourn time.

    * Default: 200
  
Respones:
---------
* avg_sojourn_time: The average of sojourn time of customers (time customers spend in the system).

* avg_waiting_time: The average of waiting time of customers.

* frac_cust_wait: The fraction of customers who wait.
