Model: Dual Sourcing System (DUALSOURCING)
==========================================

Description:
------------
Consider a single-stage, incapacitated, manufacturing location facing stochastic demand. 
The manufacturer can buy the material from a “regular” supplier at cost :math:`c_r` per unit, or, 
if needed, she can get some or all of the material “expedited” at some premium cost :math:`c_e` 
per unit with :math:`c_e > c_r`. 
Regular orders arrive after :math:`l_r` periods while expedited orders arrive after :math:`l_e` periods with 
:math:`l_e < l_r`. Let the difference in lead times be :math:`l = l_r − l_e ≥ 1`. 

If there is remaining on-hand inventory at the end of period :math:`n` (after demand :math:`d_n` is satisfied), 
these items are carried over to the next period (i.e., :math:`I_n+1 > 0`) at a holding cost per unit. 
However, if there is a stock-out (i.e., :math:`In + 1 < 0`), there is a penalty cost per unit 
of unsatisfied demand.

We will let the period :math:`n` expediting order be based on the on-hand inventory plus the orders that 
will arrive within :math:`l_e` periods (both regular and expedited). Regular orders that are due to arrive 
after :math:`l_e` periods are not considered in expedited ordering decisions. 
The expedited order is placed to restore the expedited inventory position :math:`IP_n^e`, 
to some target parameter level :math:`z_e`. The regular order :math:`X_n^r`, on the other hand, 
is based on the regular inventory position (sum of on-hand inventory and all outstanding orders, 
including the expedited order placed in the current period). Similarly, it tries to restore the regular 
inventory position :math:`IP_n^r` to the target parameter :math:`z_r`. Thus, under this model, we carry two inventory positions, 
one for regular orders and another for expedited orders.

Sources of Randomness:
----------------------
Demand follows a normal distribution.

    * Default: 50
