Solver: Random Search (RNDSRCH)
===============================

Description:
------------
Randomly sample solutions from the feasible region and use a fixed number of replications at each solution. The sampling distribution is specified inside each problem class in **get_random_solution**.

Modifications & Implementation:
-------------------------------
The new random solutions maintain the type of each variable based on the sampling distributions that are discrete for integer decisions and otherwise continuous.

Scope:
------
* objective_type: single

* constraint_type: stochastic

* variable_type: mixed

* gradient_observations: not available

Solver Factors:
---------------
* crn_across_solns: Use CRN across solutions?

    * Default: True

* sample_size: Sample size per solution > 1.

    * Default: 10
