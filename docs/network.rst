Model: Network Queueing System Design (Network)
===============================================

Description:
------------
This model represents a communication system where arriving messages are routed through a network based on chosen routing percentages. There are :math:`N` random messages that arrive following a Poisson process with a rate of :math:`Î»` that need to go to a particular destination, and there are :math:`n` networks available to process these messages. When a message arrives there is a :math:`p_i%` chance that it will be processed by network :math:`i`. The per message processing cost is :math:`c_1, c_2,..., c_i` depending on which network the message is routed through. It also takes time for a message to go through a network. This transit time is denoted by :math:`S_i` for each network :math:`i` and :math:`S_i` follows a triangular distribution with lower limit :math:`a_i`, upper limit :math:`b_i`, and mode :math:`c_i`. Each network behaves like a single-server queue with first-in-first-out service discipline.There is a cost for the length of time a message spends in network :math:`i` measured by :math:`c_i` per unit of time.

Sources of Randomness:
----------------------
    1. Interarrival time of a message.
    2. The network a message is routed to. 
    3. The transit time of a message; depends on the network.

Model Factors:
--------------
* process_prob: Probability that a message will go through a particular network i.

    * Default: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

* cost_process: Message processing cost of network i.

    * Default: [1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10]

* cost_time: Cost for the length of time a message spends in a network i per unit of time.

    * Default: [0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005]
    
* mode_transit_time: Mode time of transit for network i following a triangular distribution.

    * Default: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

* lower_limits_transit_time: Lower limits for the triangular distribution for the transit time.

    * Default: [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5]

* upper_limits_transit_time: Upper limits for the triangular distribution for the transit time.

    * Default: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5]

* arrival_rate: Arrival rate of messages following a Poisson process.

    * Default: 1
    
* n_messages: Number of messages that arrive and need to be routed.

    * Default: 1000

* n_networks: Number of networks.

    * Default: 10
    
    
Responses:
----------
* total_cost: Total cost spent to route and process all messages.

========================================================

Decision Variables:
-------------------

Objectives:
-----------
The objective is to minimize total costs, the sum of time costs and network costs for all messages.

Constraints:

* :math:`\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1`

:math:`p_1, p_2,..., p_n \in [0, 1]` are the routing probabilities.

Problem Factors:
----------------
* initial_solution: Initial solution from which solvers start.

  * Default: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]
  
* budget: Max # of replications for a solver to take.

  * Default: 1000
