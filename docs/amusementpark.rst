Model: Amusement Park Queues (AMUSEMENT)
==========================================

Description:
------------
This model simulates an amusement park with 7 attractions. Visitors arrive at
each attraction according to a poisson distribution with a rate :math:`\gamma_i = 1`,
:math:`i = 1,. . . , 7`. Each attraction can only take one visitor at a time, while
others wait in a queue with capacity :math:`c_i`. If a visitor finds a queue full,
they will immediately leave the park.

After visiting each attraction, a visitor leaves the park with probability 0.2.
Otherwise, the visitor goes to another attraction according to the transition
matrix:

The time that a visitor spends at an attraction follows an Erlang
distribution with shape parameter :math:`k = 2`` and rate :math:`\lambda = 9`.
The park opens at 9AM and closes at 5PM, and time is measured in minutes.
When the park closes, all visitors in the queue leave immediately.

Sources of Randomness:
----------------------
There are 3 sources of randomness in this model:

* The arrival rate of visitors as a poisson distribution with rate of 1 for all :math:`i = 1, . . . , 7`.

* The transition probabiliyt matrix that visitors follow after visiting each attraction.

* The time spent at each attraction as an Erlang distribution with the shape parameter :math:`k = 2` and rate = 9.

The Erlang distribution is the distribution representing a sum of :math:`k` independent exponential variables with mean :math:`1/\lambda` each.
It is a special case of the gamma distribution wherein the shape of the distribution is discretized. The probability density function
of the Erlang distribution is

:math:`f(x;k,\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^{k}x^{k-1}e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!} \quad for \ x, \beta >= 0`

where :math:`k` is the shape parameter, :math:`\lambda` is the rate parameter.

Alternatively, the pdf can be expressed as

:math:`f(x;k,\beta) = \frac{x^{k-1}e^{-x/\beta}}{\beta^k(k-1)!} \quad for \ x, \beta >= 0`

where :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter, which is the reciprocal of the rate parameter.

* Note: In this model, Erlang variates are generated through the gamma distribution with the scale (:math:`\beta:`) parameter set to 1/9.
Accordingly, the reciprocal of desired rate values should be used in the erlang_scale parameter.


Model Factors:
--------------
* park_capacity: The total number of visitors waiting for attractions that can be maintained through park facilities, distributed across the attractions.

    * Default: 350

* number_attractions: The number of attractions in the park.

    * Default: 7

* time_open: The number of minutes per day the park is open.

    * Default: 480

* erlang_shape: The shape parameter of the Erlang distribution for each attraction duration.

    * Default: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

* erlang_scale: The scale parameter of the Erlang distribution for each attraction duration (reciprocal of the rate value).

    * Default: [1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, 1/9]

* depart_probabilities: The probability that a visitor will depart the park after visiting an attraction.

    * Default: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]

* queue_capacities: The capacity of the queues for the attractions based on the portion of facilities allocated.

    * Default: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]

* arrival_gammas: The gamma values for the poisson distributions dictating the rates at which visitors entering the park arrive at each attraction.

    * Default: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

* transition_probabilities: The transition matrix that describes the probability of a visitor visiting each attraction after their current attraction.

    * Default:

Responses:
----------
* total_departed: The total number of visitors to leave the park due to full queues.

* percent_departed: The percentage of visitors to leave the park due to full queues.

* average_number_in_system: The time average of the number of visitors in the system.

* attraction_utilization_percentages: The percent utilizations for each attraction.
