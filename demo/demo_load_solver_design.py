"""Demo for Loading Solver Design Points.

This script is intended to help with loading a design of solver factors
to run on one or more problems. If more than one problem are used a cross-design of
problems will be run. The design file should be a txt or csv file with headers as
factor names and each row representing an individual design point. Design files
generated by the simopt GUI can also be run using this script. Outputs are printed to
the experiments folder in simopt.
