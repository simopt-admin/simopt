# (SSSGD) - Stratified Stopping Stochastic Gradient Descent

### About the Solver

An iterative algorithm that approximates the gradient using finite-differences, sets the step size using backtracking, allows for stratified sampling, and chooses the sample size for each stratum based on stopping time adaptive rules that keep the stochastic and optimality error in a fixed lock-step.

### Properties

**Variable Class:** Continuous.

**Constraints Class:** Unconstrained and variable bounds.
